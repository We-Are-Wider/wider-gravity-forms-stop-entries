### Selectively stop Gravity Forms entries being stored on your web server to comply with privacy and the GDPR.

Gravity Forms is a wonderful plugin and each form submission is stored on your web server and is accessible through the admin area - which can be great if you have problems with the email address you have setup to receive form submissions.

However, there is no easy way in the admin area to selectively stop entries being stored on your web server, it has to be done in code and is a bit of hassle - this plugin makes it easy to stop this potentially sensitive data being stored.

Improve the privacy of your visitors form submissions and make your website comply with the GDPR - this plugin allows you to select individual Gravity Forms you have setup and stop these entries being stored through easy to use admin options.

You will find the options under `Settings > Gravity Forms Stop Entries`.

NOTE: Requires Gravity Forms v1.8 or newer!
